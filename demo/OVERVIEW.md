# Project Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Name
Pitch Perfect AI

## ðŸš€ Summary
Pitch Perfect AI is an AI-driven web application that acts as a personal, on-demand public speaking coach. It provides a safe space for users to practice their speech and receive immediate, data-driven feedback, turning a stressful task into an engaging, game-like experience where users can "level up" their communication skills.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Real-Time Transcription:** Utilizes the browser's Web Speech API to transcribe speech live as the user talks.
- **AI-Powered Speech Analysis:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to provide a detailed scorecard, including a Clarity Score, Filler Word Count, and Pace (Words Per Minute).
- **Contextual Coaching Modes:** Users can select a scenario (e.g., "Job Interview," "Business Pitch") to receive feedback tailored to that specific context.
- **Actionable Feedback & Video Recommendations:** The AI delivers specific positive feedback, an actionable improvement suggestion, and a relevant YouTube search query to help the user find helpful learning resources.
- **Interactive & Accessible UI:** Features a clean interface with a loading spinner, a typewriter effect for AI feedback, and a fully functional Dark Mode for accessibility.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
The inspiration for Pitch Perfect AI comes from the universal challenge of public speaking. Many people, especially students preparing for presentations and professionals gearing up for interviews, lack a safe and objective way to practice. This tool was created to democratize speech coaching, making it accessible, private, and data-driven for anyone looking to build their confidence and make their voice heard.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Given more time, the following features would be prioritized to enhance the coaching experience:
- **Audio Playback:** Allowing users to listen back to their recording to hear their own tone, volume, and inflection.
- **Progress Tracking Dashboard:** A visual dashboard to track a user's scores over time, showing their improvement with graphs and charts.
- **Filler Word Highlighting:** Visually highlighting the specific filler words within the final transcript.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality:** A feature to make longer practice sessions more convenient.
