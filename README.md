## 🧐 The Problem

Public speaking is one of the most common fears and a critical skill for students and professionals alike. Getting objective, instant, and affordable feedback is nearly impossible, which makes it incredibly difficult to practice and improve effectively. How can we identify our filler words, fix our pacing, and gain confidence without the pressure of a live audience?

## ✨ The Solution

**Pitch Perfect AI** is a web-based application that acts as your personal, on-demand speaking coach. By leveraging your device's microphone and the power of Google's Gemini AI, it provides an instant, private analysis of your speech. It helps you identify weaknesses like overusing filler words or speaking too quickly, turning practice from a chore into an insightful, data-driven experience.
